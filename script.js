  Dear Neha,

  Each day without you feels like a part of me is missing. Your laughter, your kindness, your unwavering support—these are the things I find myself craving more than ever. Life seems a little less colorful without your presence by my side. There’s a void in my heart that only you can fill.

  Do you remember our countless adventures? From spontaneous road trips to quiet nights spent stargazing, each memory is etched in my mind like a precious gem. Those moments weren’t just fleeting instances; they were the foundation of a bond that I hold dearer than words can express.

  I miss our late-night conversations, where we bared our souls and shared our dreams without reservation. There’s a unique comfort in being able to be completely yourself with someone, and that’s a comfort I find only in you.

  Let’s promise to never let the miles between us dull the spark of our friendship. I long for the day when we can reunite, laugh until our stomachs ache, and create new memories that will last a lifetime. Until then, I'll cherish the memories we've made and keep you close in my thoughts and prayers.

  With each passing day, my anticipation grows stronger, knowing that soon we’ll be able to embrace and pick up right where we left off. Until then, know that you are dearly missed and loved more than words can convey.

  With all my love,
  [Your Name]
